# Spotify Data Science Project - CAU Kiel

This repository contains the work for a Data Science project from Kiel University (CAU) conducted by Armando Criscuolo, Anahita Mesgarzadeh Tehrani, Kira Schwarz and Sahand Hamed. The project focuses on analyzing various aspects of Spotify, the leading global music streaming platform.

## Project Overview

The project explores Spotify's user base, growth dynamics, market trends, and user behavior through data analysis and visualization. An interactive web application built with Dash provides insights into eight key research questions:

1.  **User Growth:** How have Spotify's monthly active users (MAU) changed worldwide over time?
2.  **Media Sentiment:** What is the relationship between media coverage sentiment about Spotify and its stock performance?
3.  **Regional Activity:** Which global regions exhibit the highest Spotify streaming activity, and how has this changed?
4.  **Free vs. Premium:** How does the ratio of free users to premium subscribers influence Spotify's revenue?
5.  **Demographics:** What demographic factors (age, gender) characterize Spotify's user base and subscription patterns?
6.  **Chart Comparison:** How do general popular music charts compare to Spotify's own popular music charts?
7.  **Price Impact:** How do changes in subscription prices affect Spotify's user growth?
8.  **Track Popularity:** Do popular tracks tend to appear more frequently in user-created playlists?

## AI Assistance Disclosure

**Note to supervisors and reviewers:** AI assistance tools were used extensively throughout this project. While not every component was directly generated by AI, these tools significantly contributed to code development, data analysis, visualization creation, and documentation. For this reason, no functions contain detailed comments about AI usage.
