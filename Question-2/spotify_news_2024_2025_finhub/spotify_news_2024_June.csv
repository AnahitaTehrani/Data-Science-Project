From its start as an invite-only service to over 600 million monthly active users, Spotify has become one of the largest music streaming providers in the world. Beyond the Ticker takes a look at the company's biggest moments as it works to ensure lasting success in a competitive market. 2006 Spotify was founded by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. The company is based in Stockholm, Sweden. 2009 After its start as an invite-only service, Spotify began offering free, but limited access, in the United Kingdom. 2011 Spotify launched in the United States in July 2011. Days later, the company received $100 million dollars in funding, valuing it at $1 billion. 2014 Taylor Swift pulled all of her music off of Spotify, claiming that ""Valuable things should be paid for"". Swift reconciled with the streamer in 2017. 2017 Spotify announced the expansion of its US operations in New York City, adding approximately 1,000 new jobs. 2018 On April 3, 2018, Spotify became a publicly traded company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SPOT. Shares opened at $165.90 each. That valued the company at $29.5 billion. 2020 The company launched its dedicated podcast unit, highlighted by exclusive deals with Joe Rogan, Bill Simmons, and more. 2023 Spotify generated over $4 billion in revenue, including 602 million monthly active users and 236 million Premium subscribers. 2024 Spotify continues to expand, now available in 184 markets across Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. It is also leaning deeper into artificial intelligence, with features like AI DJ and AI playlist – all in an effort to ride this next wave of innovation into the future. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

Spotify has been leveraging AI in its user experiences to offer its listeners everything from customized playlists to music discovery. On the advertising front, the company is rolling out a new tool called Quick Audio that will enable quick script generation and voiceovers for audio assets. Brown explains that over the next year, the major challenge will be ""sifting through the AI landscape and what that's going to bring."" He will be closely watching how the technology will impact creativity, targeting, brand safety, and performance, adding, ""I'm a big advocate that it's going to play out in a very positive way for the advertising business."" As for Spotify's future, Brown points to being much more than a music company: ""Four years ago, we were mostly known for our music company, and we still are. That's the heart of what we do. But we made a really strategic decision to become an audio company and introduce podcasts into the app. And that was at the time, they said, 'Hey, you have to keep music and podcasts separate.' That's what everyone else was doing. And we were sort of among the first that brought them together."" He points to audiobooks as a recent expansion of this idea to bring multiple forms of content to the Spotify experience. Brown adds that podcasts can also be viewed as videos to provide users dual consumption modes, and while he reiterates that Spotify will always be audio-first, he believes ""video as a companion format is something that will enhance the experience."" Alongside AI, Brown points to globalization and branding as major trends in advertising. He explains that marketers will be making ads more locally relevant to users, as well as focusing on building brand resiliency amid an inflationary environment.
