June's existing home sales data revealed a sharper decline than economists had anticipated. According to a report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), sales dropped 5.4% month-over-month to 3.89 million units, falling short of the 3.2% decrease to 3.98 million units initially predicted. The current sales level represents the lowest point since December 2023. Kristina Hooper, Invesco's chief global market strategist, attributes the housing market's challenges to the Fed's tightening cycle, which she says created ""golden handcuffs"" and forced affordability issues. However, she believes the Fed recognizes these housing market concerns, and she is optimistic about the possibility of two rate cuts in 2024, even suggesting ""there is a potential for three.""
