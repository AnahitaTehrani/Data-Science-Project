The scatter plot shows virtually no correlation (r = 0.0084, p-value = 0.9057) between Spotify news sentiment scores and next-day stock returns, with data points distributed across all four sentiment-return quadrants regardless of article volume (indicated by point size). This suggests that media coverage sentiment has negligible predictive power for Spotify's short-term stock performance.
