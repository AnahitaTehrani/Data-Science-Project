He notes that advertising is increasingly digital, making it ""very agile in terms of turning it on and turning it off."" Therefore, traditional media giants are now competing against platforms like Google\'s (GOOG, GOOGL) YouTube TV and TikTok. As Disney (DIS) may have to pay $5 billion more to buy Comcast\'s (CMCSA) stake in Hulu, Leon explains that CEO Bob Iger is ""looking at streaming besides sports and saying we need general entertainment. So Hulu rounds out our offering along with our family Disney+. That\'s where we are. The deal will get done."" He anticipates the deal to close by January, and while it may be a significant move for Disney, he adds, ""I\'m not sure that\'s a driver or a catalyst for the stock.""

Alongside AI, Brown points to globalization and branding as major trends in advertising.
