From its start as an invite-only service to over 600 million monthly active users, Spotify has become one of the largest music streaming providers in the world. Beyond the Ticker takes a look at the company's biggest moments as it works to ensure lasting success in a competitive market. 2006 Spotify was founded by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. The company is based in Stockholm, Sweden. 2009 After its start as an invite-only service, Spotify began offering free, but limited access, in the United Kingdom. 2011 Spotify launched in the United States in July 2011. Days later, the company received $100 million dollars in funding, valuing it at $1 billion. 2014 Taylor Swift pulled all of her music off of Spotify, claiming that ""Valuable things should be paid for"". Swift reconciled with the streamer in 2017. 2017 Spotify announced the expansion of its US operations in New York City, adding approximately 1,000 new jobs. 2018 On April 3, 2018, Spotify became a publicly traded company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SPOT. Shares opened at $165.90 each. That valued the company at $29.5 billion. 2020 The company launched its dedicated podcast unit, highlighted by exclusive deals with Joe Rogan, Bill Simmons, and more. 2023 Spotify generated over $4 billion in revenue, including 602 million monthly active users and 236 million Premium subscribers. 2024 Spotify continues to expand, now available in 184 markets across Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. It is also leaning deeper into artificial intelligence, with features like AI DJ and AI playlist – all in an effort to ride this next wave of innovation into the future. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

Spotify has been leveraging AI in its user experiences to offer its listeners everything from customized playlists to music discovery. On the advertising front, the company is rolling out a new tool called Quick Audio that will enable quick script generation and voiceovers for audio assets. Brown explains that over the next year, the major challenge will be ""sifting through the AI landscape and what that's going to bring."" He will be closely watching how the technology will impact creativity, targeting, brand safety, and performance, adding, ""I'm a big advocate that it's going to play out in a very positive way for the advertising business."" As for Spotify's future, Brown points to being much more than a music company: ""Four years ago, we were mostly known for our music company, and we still are. That's the heart of what we do. But we made a really strategic decision to become an audio company and introduce podcasts into the app. And that was at the time, they said, 'Hey, you have to keep music and podcasts separate.' That's what everyone else was doing. And we were sort of among the first that brought them together."" He points to audiobooks as a recent expansion of this idea to bring multiple forms of content to the Spotify experience. Brown adds that podcasts can also be viewed as videos to provide users dual consumption modes, and while he reiterates that Spotify will always be audio-first, he believes ""video as a companion format is something that will enhance the experience."" Alongside AI, Brown points to globalization and branding as major trends in advertising. He explains that marketers will be making ads more locally relevant to users, as well as focusing on building brand resiliency amid an inflationary environment.

June's existing home sales data revealed a sharper decline than economists had anticipated. According to a report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), sales dropped 5.4% month-over-month to 3.89 million units, falling short of the 3.2% decrease to 3.98 million units initially predicted. The current sales level represents the lowest point since December 2023. Kristina Hooper, Invesco's chief global market strategist, attributes the housing market's challenges to the Fed's tightening cycle, which she says created ""golden handcuffs"" and forced affordability issues. However, she believes the Fed recognizes these housing market concerns, and she is optimistic about the possibility of two rate cuts in 2024, even suggesting ""there is a potential for three."" The Russell 2000 (^RUT) index is under pressure after seeing a five-day winning streak last week. F.L. Putnam Investment Management Co. chief market strategist and portfolio manager Ellen Hazen argues that the small-cap rally was ""premature,"" and notes that small-cap earnings revisions for the next year keep decreasing while S&P 500 (^GSPC) earnings revisions keep increasing, saying, ""So what looks like a cheap valuation is not as cheap as it looks."" Yahoo Finance reporters Dan Howley and Pras Subramanian break down the top areas investors should focus on from Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) and Tesla's (TSLA) latest earnings. Meanwhile, pharmacy benefits manager (PMB) executives are testifying before Congress about the price of prescription drugs and how they can be lowered.

US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned from her post on Tuesday, according to several reports, after testifying before House lawmakers on the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump's life last week at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

Leon believes that Netflix (NFLX) is the streamer best positioned to capitalize off of ad revenue. He also points to Spotify (SPOT) as a top player in music streaming.  ""Advertisers follow where viewership is growing, which is the continued pivot from legacy networks,"" Leon says. He notes that advertising is increasingly digital, making it ""very agile in terms of turning it on and turning it off."" Therefore, traditional media giants are now competing against platforms like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) YouTube TV and TikTok. As Disney (DIS) may have to pay $5 billion more to buy Comcast's (CMCSA) stake in Hulu, Leon explains that CEO Bob Iger is ""looking at streaming besides sports and saying we need general entertainment. So Hulu rounds out our offering along with our family Disney+. That's where we are. The deal will get done."" He anticipates the deal to close by January, and while it may be a significant move for Disney, he adds, ""I'm not sure that's a driver or a catalyst for the stock."" Disney reported an overall earnings beat on its top and bottom line for its fiscal third quarter, the media giant expecting profitability in its streaming segments despite some pressures.
