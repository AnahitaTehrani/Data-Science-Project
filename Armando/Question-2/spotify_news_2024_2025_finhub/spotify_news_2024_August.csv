Leon believes that Netflix (NFLX) is the streamer best positioned to capitalize off of ad revenue. He also points to Spotify (SPOT) as a top player in music streaming.  ""Advertisers follow where viewership is growing, which is the continued pivot from legacy networks,"" Leon says. He notes that advertising is increasingly digital, making it ""very agile in terms of turning it on and turning it off."" Therefore, traditional media giants are now competing against platforms like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) YouTube TV and TikTok. As Disney (DIS) may have to pay $5 billion more to buy Comcast's (CMCSA) stake in Hulu, Leon explains that CEO Bob Iger is ""looking at streaming besides sports and saying we need general entertainment. So Hulu rounds out our offering along with our family Disney+. That's where we are. The deal will get done."" He anticipates the deal to close by January, and while it may be a significant move for Disney, he adds, ""I'm not sure that's a driver or a catalyst for the stock."" Disney reported an overall earnings beat on its top and bottom line for its fiscal third quarter, the media giant expecting profitability in its streaming segments despite some pressures.
