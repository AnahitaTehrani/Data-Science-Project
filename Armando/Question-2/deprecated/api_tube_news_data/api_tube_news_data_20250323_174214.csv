On its most basic level, Pell alleges that Spotify has teamed up with stock music companies and artists to supply music for mood-oriented and background-based playlists. Plus, as MiDiA rightfully observes, “Spotify would theoretically benefit from users listening to more PFC tracks, because the platform does not need to pay out most royalties for those streams. Well, while it’s disheartening to see music sometimes being treated as mere background noise or decor without its deeper identity and artistry, what gives me pause is the potential shift away from Spotify’s original mission."

In August, Spotify filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, calling the MLC’s position “nonsensical and factually unsupportable”. And while the judge in the case avoided that kind of language in her ruling yesterday, she nevertheless came down on Spotify’s side. The key question was whether adding audiobooks made Spotify a bundle under the definition set out by the US streaming rates system. Premium is, therefore, properly categorized as a Bundle,” ruled Judge Analisa Torres, who described the regulations governing this as “unambiguous”."
